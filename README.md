#Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics
This is the code repository for [Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/beginning-natural-language-processing?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788838535), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

##About the Book
Discover how you can perform your own modern text analysis, to make predictions, create inferences, and gain insights about the data around you today. Learn how to harness the powerful Python ecosystem and tools such as spaCy and Gensim to perform natural language processing, and computational linguistics algorithms.

##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
print('Build model...')
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(max_features, 128))
model.add(LSTM(128, dropout=0.2, recurrent_dropout=0.2))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
```
